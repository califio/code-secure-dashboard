# Security Integration

Your applicationâ€™s repository typically includes source code, dependency configurations. 
By performing repository scanning, vulnerabilities across these components can be identified.
We utilize open-source tools to integrate security scanning.

Security scanning tools include:

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Examines the source code to uncover vulnerabilities.
- **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**: Detects vulnerabilities in application dependencies and container images.
